# 2.-To-Do-App

Created a simple (aka not so simple) to do list using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

The Add button adds individual tasks to the list, however you can delete one/multiple completed items at at time.

Added alerts to ensure non empty to dos are not entered accidently.

p.s. the to do list disappears after the page refresh.
