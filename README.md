# 2.-To-Do-App

Created a simple (aka not so simple) to do list using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

The Add button adds individual tasks to the list, however you can delete one/multiple completed items at at time.

Added alerts to ensure non empty to dos are not entered accidently and an alert to check if you are sure you want to delete the tasks (in case some were added that were not meant to be).

p.s. the to do list disappears after the page refresh.
